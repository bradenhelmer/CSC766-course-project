# CSC 766 Course Project - High Level Semantic-Based Code Optimization
## Overview
### Authors: Braden Helmer & Sogolsadat Mansouri <br>
This repository contains code for NCSU's CSC-766 final course project on high-level semantic-based code optimizations. The optimization chose for this project is 'GLORE: Generalized Loop Redundancy Elimination upon LER-Notation', research done by our professor, Dr. Xipeng Shen and his former student, Dr. Yufei Ding. The paper can be accessed [here](https://research.csc.ncsu.edu/picture/publications/papers/oopsla17.pdf).

There are two sub directories in this repository:<br>  
- <strong>PartI_ManualOpt</strong>: This directory contains all the manual optimizations done from the test programs provided. There is another README inside that contains further details on the directory structure and how to run/build the test programs.
- <strong>PartII_AutoOp</strong>: This directory contains all the source code for the LER optimizer. Another README inside the folder provides further details on building and testing.
